<p>From western Philadelphia I hail
where in my youth I'd play upon the green
'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
by ruffians contemptible and mean.
Although the spat was trivial and brief,
it wounded my dear mother deep within;
and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
I came upon a coachman most unique;
and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
I survey all the land with princely mien
in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>
